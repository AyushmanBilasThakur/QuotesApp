  <h1>About the app</h1>
  <p>
    QuotesApp is an app where you can share your thoughts and quotes with no
    account and without even revealing your real name. This app is special as
    you won't need any user account to do anything in this app, each and every
    device uses its local storage to store some data and thus your computer
    becomes the local account for you. So enjoy sharing your thoughts
    anonymously with other people in this platform Quotesapp is a personal
    project of mine, and it is my first project intended to be in my portfolio.
    I'm hosting this site on github that means it is open source. I will provide
    the source link here.
